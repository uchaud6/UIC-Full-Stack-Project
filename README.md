# UIC-Full-Stack-Project
Using Python's flask module with Standard HTML and CSS, I created an application that allows the user to search for MSCS faculty at the University of Illinois in Chicago with a frontend that mirrors the design of the UIC website. The goal of this project is to build an application that could go into development and use for the UIC website.
